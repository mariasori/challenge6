# Challenge 6

## Server-Side APIs

This challenge required me to create a Weather Dashboard. When a user searches a city by name, the current and 5 day future forecast appear.  Information shown includes date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index which is color coded to indicate severity, and an icon for the weather condition.  Each searched city is saved and the user can click on previous searches to see each city's weather conditions.
